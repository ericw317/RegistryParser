This is a work in progress. Currently only works well with SAM hives. More will be added soon.

What This Does
--------------
This program allows you to analyze registry hives. It has two features. The first feature is a manual viewer, which allows you to manually look through the registry hive. The second feature is a hive parser that will automatically search the hive for relevant data and
output it to the user in a readable format.

How To Use
----------
Using the hive parser is very straight-forward. The manual viewer feature might need some explaining. If you start up the manual viewer, the screen display will show the current directory, all available subkeys, and all available key values. The following commands are
used to navigate the viewer:

Navigating to another key director - Simply type it in and press enter

Going back to the previous directory - Type in 'back'

Exit the program - Type '0'
